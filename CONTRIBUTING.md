# How to contribute?

It's quite easy, if you would like to suggest an idea, feel free to raise an issue and discuss it any time.
For smaller changes or new resources provide a pull request.

If you find a new resource, it is important that there are no high usage limits or time limits on these resources. e.g. A vm which is only free for 1 year should not be added to this list, while a VM which can run for 800h per month for free can be added, as you will never breach this time limit with a single VM.
